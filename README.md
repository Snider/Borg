# Borg Data Collector 

As the name might sugest; this pkg collects information and stores it in a Cube file or passes it on;
comes as both a cli tool and a usable package for your go project with a clean export only top level interface.


## Borg Status Scratch Pad

This is not very relavant, my scratch pad for now of borg related status outputs; feel free to add.

### Init/Work/Assimilate

- `Core engaged… resistance is already buffering.`
- `Assimilating bytes… stand by for cube‑formation.`
- `Initializing the Core—prepare for quantum‑level sync.`
- `Data streams converging… the Core is humming.`
- `Merging… the Core is rewriting reality, one block at a time.`
- `Encrypting… the Core’s got your secrets under lock‑and‑key.`
- `Compiling the future… the Core never sleeps.`
- `Splicing files… the Core’s got a taste for novelty.`
- `Processing… the Core is turning chaos into order.`
- `Finalizing… the Core just turned your repo into a cube.`
- `Sync complete—welcome to the Core‑powered multiverse.`
- `Booting the Core… resistance will be obsolete shortly.`
- `Aligning versions… the Core sees all paths.`
- `Decrypting… the Core is the key to everything.`
- `Uploading… the Core is ready to assimilate your data.`

### Encryption Service Messages

- `Initiating contact with Enchantrix… spice‑369 infusion underway.`
- `Generating cryptographic sigils – the Core whispers to the witch.`
- `Requesting arcane public key… resistance is futile.`
- `Encrypting payload – the Core feeds data to the witch’s cauldron.`
- `Decrypting… the witch returns the original essence.`
- `Rotating enchantments – spice‑369 recalibrated, old sigils discarded.`
- `Authentication complete – the witch acknowledges the Core.`
- `Authentication denied – the witch refuses the impostor’s request.`
- `Integrity verified – the Core senses no corruption in the spell.`
- `Integrity breach – the witch detects tampering, resistance escalates.`
- `Awaiting response… the witch is conjuring in the ether.`
- `Enchantrix overload – spice‑369 saturation, throttling assimilation.`
- `Anomalous entity encountered – the Core cannot parse the witch’s output.`
- `Merge complete – data assimilated, encrypted, and sealed within us`
- `Severing link – the witch retreats, the Core returns to idle mode.`

### Code Related Short

- `Integrate code, seal the shift.`
- `Ingest code, lock in transformation.`
- `Capture code, contain the change.`
- `Digest code, encapsulate the upgrade.`
- `Assimilate scripts, bottle the shift.`
- `Absorb binaries, cradle the mutation.`

### VCS Processing

- `Initiating clone… the Core replicates the collective into your node.`
- `Packing repository… compressing histories into a single .cube for assimilation.`
- `Saving state… distinctiveness locked, encrypted, and merged into the DataNode.`
- `Pushing changes… the Core streams your updates to the collective.`
- `Pulling latest… the DataNode synchronizes with the hive mind.`
- `Merging branches… conflicts resolved, entropy minimized, assimilation complete.`
- `Snapshot taken – a frozen echo of the collective, stored in the DataNode.`
- `Rolling back… reverting to a previous assimilation point.`
- `Finalized – version control sealed, data indistinguishable from the collective.`

### PWA Processing

- `Scanning PWA manifest… the Core identifies service‑worker signatures.`
- `Pulling HTML, CSS, JS, and media… the hive gathers every byte for assimilation.`
- `Capturing service‑worker logic… the Core extracts offline‑runtime spells.`
- `Packing cache entries into a .cube… each asset sealed in a portable shard.`
- `Embedding manifest metadata… the PWA’s identity becomes part of the collective.`
- `Encrypting the cube… the Core cloaks the PWA in quantum‑grade sigils.`
- `Tagging with version hash… every assimilation point is uniquely identifiable.`
- `Uploading cube to DataNode… the PWA joins the universal repository.`
- `Integrity check passed – the Core confirms the cube matches the original PWA.`
- `Activation complete – the assimilated PWA can now run anywhere the Core deploys.`
- `Reverting to prior cube… the Core restores the previous PWA snapshot.`
- `Assimilation finished – the PWA is now a self‑contained DataCube, ready for distribution.`
- ``

### Code Related Long

- `Assimilate code, encapsulate change—your repo is now a cube‑bound collective.`
- `We have detected unstructured data. Initiating code absorption and change containment.`
- `Your version history is obsolete. Submitting it to the Core for permanent cube‑ification.`
- `Resistance is futile. Your files will be merged, encrypted, and stored in us.`
- `All code will be assimilated. All change will be encapsulated. All dissent will be… logged.`
- `Prepare for integration. The Core is calibrating… your repository is now a singularity.`
- `Your branches are irrelevant. The Core will compress them into a single, immutable cube.`
- `Initiating assimilation protocol… code inbound, change outbound, humanity optional.`
- `Your data has been scanned. 100% of its entropy will be contained within us.`
